Shopping cart is software/application used by product owners, sellers to help there costumer purchases and pay online.

This software is providing products online where buyers can choose the product and add to cart (a virtual basket) and make online payment. The software doesn't include client payment information (usually credit card number) and process the transaction using available secure payment gateway.

My goal here is to create a very basic shopping cart program using php/mysql/codeigniter to get a better understanding of how shopping cart works.
Our Shopping Cart program allows visitors to your on-line shopping site to collect items in a virtual shopping cart over multiple product web pages without losing the items ordered. Our cart keeps track of what the shopper has ordered with a id There are no cookies used, so our software will work through a firewall and with older browsers.

Shoppers may view the contents of their shopping cart at any time and may add or delete items as needed. The program automatically calculates the subtotal, sales tax, shipping charges, and grand total. When a visitor decides to checkout, the order information including the buyer's name, address and billing instruction is emailed to your order department (or whomever you choose) and a email is sent to the shopper.
